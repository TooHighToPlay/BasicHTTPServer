## How to:

To test this basic HTTP server I suggest to download:

* ALL -         http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/downloads/list
* GUI version - http://code.google.com/p/rest-client/downloads/detail?name=restclient-ui-3.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar&can=2&q=

To run it simply write in console:

* java -jar restclient-ui-3.1-jar-with-dependencies.jar

Default server location:
* http://localhost:8080

To change default properties:

    * Go to configuration.properties file
    * Change the values

To run python server simply write in terminal:
* python Main.py

## Testing with RESTClient

* Enter URL - example: localhost:8080
* Select Post method
* Select 'Body' tab -> then from drop down select String body, select type application/xml -> add sample text
* Press big green button >>
* As simple as that!!
